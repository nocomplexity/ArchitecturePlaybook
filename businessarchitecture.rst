Business Architecture
=====================

A Business Architecture defines the structure of your organization in
terms of its governance structure, business processes, business services
and products, business information and stakeholders. A business
architecture outlines the relation to strategic goals towards a working
system. So in short a business architecture can be regarded as a
blueprint of the working of an organization. By using a business
architecture your organisation can handle changes and problems with less
cost and in less time since you know all the important dependencies,
relation and information flows.  Every successful organisation, small or
large, SHOULD have a business architecture. A business architecture does
not have to be fully descriptive, complete or created among a certain
standard. Designing organisations and describing the working of an
organisation is know to be complex and hard. However simple tools exist
to create a meaningful business architecture for your organisation.

This section is created to speed up the process for creating a real
business architecture.

You can use one of the following tools:

-  Business architecture template(s)
-  (Re)use  business principles
-  Modeling your business processes
-  Defining your business products

Tools for creating a business architecture
------------------------------------------

To speed up the process of creating your business architecture you can
make use of one of the following tools:

-  `Collection <https://principles.design/>`__ of many nice design
   principles used by companies (180+ examples).
-  `Archi <http://www.archimatetool.com/>`__.  Archi™ GUI tool for
   creating a business architecture using the ArchiMate modelling™
   language. The Archi tool is targeted toward all levels of Architects.
   The tool is MIT Licensed, so it provides a low cost solution to users
   who are looking for a free, open ArchiMate modeling tool. 
   
   Warning: Using archimate is in essence not agile. So mainly large corporations and governments use it. Archimate is an Enterprise Architecture (EA) modelling language. So not suited for software modelling and software engineering. It is however very good for business modelling and creating high level relations to IT systems.

-  `Causal Loop
   Diagram <https://nocomplexity.com/causalloopdiagram/>`__. Tool to
   make easy causal loop diagrams in your browser. A causal loop diagram
   (CLD) is a causal diagram that aids in visualizing how different
   variables in a system are interrelated. This FOSS tool has an nice
   animation to presents effects also! The original (OSS) source can be
   found `here <https://github.com/ncase/loopy>`__. But the version on
   `NOComplexity.com <https://nocomplexity.com/causalloopdiagram>`__
   is a (GPL) fork with some extra features ( `source code <https://github.com/nocomplexity/causalloopdiagram/>`__ ).
-  `Camunda Modeler <https://camunda.org/download/modeler/>`__. Camunda
   Modeler is an OSS desktop application for editing BPMN process
   diagrams(2.0) and DMN decision tables. Business Process Model and
   Notation (BPMN) is the global standard for process modeling and one
   of the most important components of successful Business-IT-Alignment.
   BPMN is an open standard. But there are not many good OSS available
   packages available. Camunda Modeler is an OSS BPMN solution and is
   part of an open source platform for workflow and business process
   management. So when you use the `Camunda
   Suite <https://camunda.org/>`__ you can also use the execution engine
   for your processes you have modeled.
-  `Protégé <http://protege.stanford.edu/>`__. Protégé is an OSS web or
   desktop application that can be used for building business
   ontologies.
-  `DrawIO <https://www.draw.io/>`__. A online FOSS program to create diagrams. Its a very advanced, but also very simple to use program to create all types of (business) diagrams. UML, BPMN, ArchiMate, swimlane diagrams and many more. If you like to create good diagrams fast, think of using this program. Since its FOSS the source can be found on https://github.com/jgraph/drawio if you want to host it yourself. There is also a desktop version (electron build) of draw.io. Check https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop.



Business architecture templates
-------------------------------

Creating a business architecture means doing real business research.
However for a quality business architecture it make sense to make use of
a draft template. From a template you can easily add, remove or change
subjects that need special attention within your context. Also since
architecture documents always should be created for a clear business
goal and to be used by different stakeholders, all quality documents
SHOULD contain some default reusable text blocks.

-  `Basic business architecture
   template <https://nocomplexity.com/basic-business-architecture-template/>`__
-  `Stakeholder
   template <https://nocomplexity.com/stakeholder-template/>`__
-  `Business
   Architecture. <https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/system/files/BA%20for%20validation.pdf_en>`__
   EU template/document that describes the product, service strategy,
   organizational, functional, process, information, and geographic
   aspects of the business architecture.
-  `Business Architecture Document
   Template. <http://opensdlc.org/support-files/SDLC-RUP-Control-of-Quality-Records.pdf>`__
   Typical Togaf(tm) like business architecture template.

 

Using business viewpoints
-------------------------

Viewpoints can provide benefit to address specific concerns for certain
stakeholders. Below a list of most used viewpoint within a business
architecture:

-  Motivation view: describes what the business achieves for itself and
   its stakeholders (direct and indirect value).
-  Capability view: describes how the business delivers direct and
   indirect value in response to the challenges of the environment.
-  Activity view: describes the day-to-day behaviour of the business.
-  Responsibility view: captures the relationships between individuals
   and organizations in terms of responsibilities and commitments.
   These  relationships and organizational interfaces may be represented
   as business services.
